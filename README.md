- Verification: Students can get verified on the platform to get access to labs by scanning their QR codes.
- Lab Entry Tracking: To ensure safety and security, students can scan a unique QR code upon entering the lab. This feature allows the platform to track each student's entry and exit times, providing lab supervisors with a record of students' lab access. 
- Lab Lock/Unlock Feature: Lab supervisors can use an administrative app to lock or unlock the lab. This feature ensures that the lab is only accessible to authorized personnel and that sensitive equipment and materials remain secure. Lab supervisors can also use this feature to control access to the lab during maintenance, cleaning, or other activities that require the lab to be closed temporarily. Students attempting to access the lab during locked periods will receive a notification through the platform informing them of the lab's status and when it will be available again.
